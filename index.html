					<h3>A New Beginning</h3>
					<div>
						<p>One of the last few good games from the series before Harvest Moon's vibes completely changed and the former team working on it lost the rights to the English name. Truly, a new beginning.</p>
						<p>In order to publish their amazing games, the original developers needed a publisher that would translate their games for English-speaking audiences, Natsume. However, when the developers switched to a different publisher, Natsume took hold of the original and iconic name since they owned the rights to the English name, Harvest Moon.</p>

					<h3>Story of Seasons</h3>
					<div>
						<p>The return of the true Harvest Moon games! The former quality and care for the characters, environment, and gameplay return. Natsume shall never take the true Harvest Moon games away from us, no matter how many bad imitations they make.
						</p>
						<p>Trio of Towns is amazing, but a little harder than former games because, as the name suggests, you are spending your efforts on 3 different towns.</p>

							Fun fact: More recent games by the Story of Seasons franchise revisit the old games by the company, such as the iconic Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town!
